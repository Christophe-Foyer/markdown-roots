## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Christophe, a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Engineer focused on building practical, reliable systems that operate in the real world. I work independently as a consultant, helping startups and engineering teams take machine learning projects from proof-of-concept to production.

I specialize in computer vision and applied ML applied to tangible problems, with a strong track record in robotics, perception pipelines, and end-to-end infrastructure. Whether you're validating a prototype or scaling up a deployment, I bring a pragmatic, engineering-driven approach to solving complex problems.

## What I Do

I help teams build and deploy machine learning systems - especially in challenging, fuzzy environments like robotics. My work spans the full ML lifecycle:

- Dataset design and data tooling  
- Model development and optimization  
- Evaluation pipelines and reproducibility  
- Scalable, testable deployment architectures  
- Debugging in-the-loop performance in production  

My focus is always on shipping systems that are not just performant, but easily maintainable and robust, leading to lower costs and headaches in the long-run.

## Consulting & Availability

I'm currently working as an independent consultant, collaborating remotely from the UK with global teams. My recent work has involved developing production-ready ML and computer vision pipelines for robotics startups and early-stage ventures.

I'm available for new consulting engagements, particularly where there's a need to bridge the gap between machine learning research and real-world deployment. If you're looking for someone who can move fast, ship reliably, and think out of the box, feel free to get in touch.
